Installing pepper dependencies
---

= Tools
    Most distributions will have these tools available as binary packages.

    1. python 2.x
        Make sure to install the development package, e.g., python-dev on debian
    2. java >= 1.7
    3. go >= 1.0.2
        http://golang.org/doc/install/source
    4. gcc, g++
        You will need g++ version 4.7.3 or later for C++11 support.
    5. Apache ant
    6. NVidia CUDA SDK (if you want to use the experimental GPU code)
    7. GNU Make
    8. GNU time
    9. Boost
    10. MySQL (for baseline measurements vs. Pantry database operations)

= Packages.
    We have archived known-working versions of these packages at
    https://github.com/pepper-project/thirdparty
    The most up-to-date versions should also work.

    When you've finished installing all of these, you should run
            sudo ldconfig
    for good measure.

    1. gmp
        https://gmplib.org
        Most linux distributions have a binary gmp distribution available. Be
        sure to install the development package (i.e., the one that includes
        header files in addition to the libraries).

        If you need to build libgmp from source, obtain and unpack the gmp
        tarball and cd to the resulting directory, then:

            ./configure --enable-cxx
            make
            sudo make install

    2. PAPI
        http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi
        Unpack the tarball and cd to the resulting directory, then:

            ./configure
            make
            make test # optional
            sudo make install
            sudo make install-man

    3. chacha-ref or chacha-fast
        On 32-bit machines, use chacha-ref. On 64-bit machines, use chacha-fast.
        Unpack chacha tarball and cd to the resulting directory, then

            make
            sudo make install

    4. NTL
        http://shoup.net/ntl/download.html
        Unpack the tarball and cd into the resulting directory, then:

            cd src
            ./configure NTL_GMP_LIP=on
            make
            sudo make install

    5. libconfig
        http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig
        Unpack the tarball and cd into the resulting directory, then:

            ./configure
            make
            sudo make install
            sudo ldconfig

    6. Cheetah template library
        http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/
        Your linux distribution may have a 'python-dev' package available; you
        should install this so that cheetah is able to compile the faster C
        backend library.
        Unpack the tarball and cd into the resulting directory, then:

            python setup.py install

    7. OpenMPI
        Your linux distribution will likely have an OpenMPI package available.
        Remember to install the development package, which includes header
        files.

    8. GMPMEE
        Unpack the tarball and cd into the resulting directory, then:

            make
            sudo make install

    9. OpenSSL
        Your linux distribution will likely have OpenSSL packages available.
        Remember to install the development package, which includes header
        files.

    10. fcgi
        http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/
        Unpack the tarball and cd into the resulting directory, then:

            ./configure
            make
            sudo make install

    11. PBC
        http://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/
        Unpack the tarball and cd into the resulting directory, then:

            ./configure LDFLAGS="-lgmp"
            make
            sudo make install

    12. Kyoto Cabinet
        http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/api
        Unpack the tarball and cd into the resulting directory, then:

            ./configure
            make
            sudo make install

    13. LevelDB
        http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/downloads/list
        Unpack the tarball and cd into the resulting directory, then:

            make
            make check
            sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/include/leveldb
            sudo cp include/leveldb/* /usr/local/include/leveldb
            sudo cp -d libleveldb.* /usr/local/lib
            sudo ldconfig

    14. LLVM/Clang with BuffetFSM patches
        See code/compiler/buffetfsm/README.md

= Submodules.
    1.  On the main directory run
            git submodule init
            git submodule update
        to pull the submodules the project depends on.

    2.  Prepare the libsnark submodule
        From the main directory
            cd libsnark
            ./prepare-depends.sh
            make lib STATIC=1
        and make sure that USE_LIBSNARK=1 is set in the pepper/flags file.
